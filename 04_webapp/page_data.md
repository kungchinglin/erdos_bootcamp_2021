# Data Gathering

Our dataset consists of all reddit posts from January 1, 2021 to mid May across several financial subreddits. Additionally, we have gathered tweets with certain keywords as well as the stock exchange data for the ticks of interest from the same period. In the following, we will describe the data by category.


## Reddit Posts

There are two main APIs for reddit posts: PRAW and Pushshift. Although there are numerous features available, we chose to keep the following ones: subreddit, author, title, post body (texts in the posts if any), external links (links to figures, videos, or external websites), submission time, and score (total upvotes minus downvotes). The list of available features can be found here: [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/submission.html), [Pushshift](https://github.com/pushshift/api).
