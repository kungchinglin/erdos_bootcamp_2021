# Future Works

Due to the time constraints, we have a few ideas we could not try out but hope to do so in the near future.

## BERT
For deriving contexts, BERT is an excellent tool. However, we did not have the time to train this model.

## Image Transcription
For reddit posts, there are a lot of meme posts that became viral. However, we were not able to decipher the contents of the images with our current data gathering techniques. If we have that information, perhaps we can predict the popularity more reliably.

## Translation of Prediction to Other Subreddits
Right now we can only predict posts in certain subreddits, and the generalization to other subreddits is not yet explored. We hope to investigate whether it is possible to at least extend to similar subreddits with our model.

## More Detailed Inspection on the Mis-classified Posts
We did not check carefully what posts the models misclassified due to time constraints, but maybe we will gain some insights if we do so.

## Extension to Twitter
We hope to extend our models to tweets in the near future. We already have the first iteration finished.
